# Development Scripts Validation Report

## Fixes Implemented - Task 009 Critical and High Priority Issues

### CRITICAL FIXES ‚úÖ

#### 1. dev.sh - Signal Trap for Ctrl+C ‚úÖ
**Issue**: No cleanup on interrupt, causing orphaned processes
**Fix**: Added cleanup function with signal traps
```bash
# Cleanup function
cleanup() {
  # Graceful SIGTERM
  # Force SIGKILL if needed
  # Exit with cleanup
}

# Trap signals
trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM EXIT
```
**Validation**: Process IDs tracked, graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C, no orphaned processes

#### 2. dev.ps1 - Error Handling and Cleanup ‚úÖ
**Issue**: No error handling, process tracking, or cleanup
**Fix**: Complete error handling infrastructure
```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
$Script:BackendProcess = $null
$Script:FrontendProcess = $null

function Cleanup { ... }
Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier PowerShell.Exiting -Action { Cleanup }

try { ... }
catch { ... }
finally { Cleanup }
```
**Validation**: Port-based cleanup, process tracking, error messages, graceful exit

#### 3. clean.sh - Dangerous Find Command ‚úÖ
**Issue**: `find . -exec rm -rf {} +` can modify directories during traversal
**Fix**: Safe find with null-terminated output
```bash
find src -type d \( -name "bin" -o -name "obj" \) -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' dir; do
  rm -rf "$dir"
done
```
**Validation**: No directory modification during traversal, scoped to src/ only

#### 4. All .sh Scripts - Working Directory Validation ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Scripts fail when run from wrong directory
**Fix**: Added validation to all scripts
```bash
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/.." && pwd)"

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_ROOT/package.json" ]] || [[ ! -d "$PROJECT_ROOT/src" ]]; then
  echo "‚ùå Error: Must run from project root or scripts directory"
  exit 1
fi
```
**Validation**: Scripts auto-navigate to project root, clear error messages

---

### HIGH PRIORITY FIXES ‚úÖ

#### 5. test.sh - Graceful When Tests Don't Exist ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Hard failures during M0 when no tests exist
**Fix**: Graceful degradation with informative messages
```bash
if dotnet test --list-tests --filter Category=Unit 2>/dev/null | grep -q "The following Tests are available"; then
  # Run tests
else
  echo "   ‚ö†Ô∏è  No unit tests found (expected during M0)"
fi

# Summary
if [[ $TESTS_RUN -eq 0 ]]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  No tests found - this is expected during M0"
  exit 0  # Success exit
fi
```
**Validation**: No failures when tests missing, milestone-aware messages, exit 0

#### 6. build.sh - Output Verification ‚úÖ
**Issue**: No verification that build artifacts were created
**Fix**: Post-build verification with size reporting
```bash
# Verify backend output
BACKEND_DLL=$(find . -path "*/bin/Release/net8.0/Api.dll")
if [[ -z "$BACKEND_DLL" ]]; then
  echo "‚ùå Backend build failed - Api.dll not found"
  exit 1
fi

# Verify frontend output
if [[ ! -d "dist" ]] || [[ ! -f "dist/index.html" ]]; then
  echo "‚ùå Frontend build failed - dist/index.html not found"
  exit 1
fi
```
**Validation**: Build failures detected, artifact paths verified, size reported

#### 7. package.json - Cross-Platform npm Scripts ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Unix-only script paths in npm scripts
**Fix**: Cross-platform script runner
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node scripts/run-script.js dev",
    "dev:sh": "./scripts/dev.sh",
    "dev:ps1": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/dev.ps1",
    ...
  }
}
```
**Validation**: Auto-detects OS, runs .sh on Unix/.ps1 on Windows, fallback scripts available

## Validation Test Results

### Test 1: Working Directory Validation ‚úÖ
```bash
$ cd /tmp && /path/to/flowingly/scripts/clean.sh
# Auto-navigates to project root, executes successfully
```

### Test 2: Graceful Test Failure ‚úÖ
```bash
$ ./scripts/test.sh
üß™ Running all tests...
‚ö†Ô∏è  No tests found - this is expected during M0 (scaffold phase)
   Tests will be added in M1 (TDD cycles) and M3 (E2E tests)
$ echo $?
0  # Exit code 0 (success)
```

### Test 3: Cross-Platform Script Runner ‚úÖ
```bash
$ node scripts/run-script.js clean
üîß Running clean.sh on linux...
‚úÖ Clean complete!

# On Windows, would run clean.ps1 automatically
```

### Test 4: Safe Find Command ‚úÖ
```bash
$ ./scripts/clean.sh
# No errors about directory modification during traversal
# Scoped to src/ directory only
```
