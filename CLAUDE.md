# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Flowingly Parsing Service** â€” A modular text-ingestion and parsing service that extracts structured data from free-form text containing inline tags and XML islands, starting with Expense Claims processing.

### Core Objective
Accept raw text (e.g., email bodies), validate tag integrity, extract expense data, compute NZ GST tax breakdowns (from inclusive totals), and return normalized JSON. Non-expense content is stored as "Other/Unprocessed" for future processors.

### Current Project State
**Phase**: âœ… M2 Complete â†’ Ready for M3 UI & E2E Tests (40/50 tasks, 80% complete)
- âœ… M0 Minimal Scaffold Complete (10/10 tasks)
- âœ… M1 Core Parsing & Validation Complete (20/20 tasks, 116 unit tests)
- âœ… M2 API Contracts Complete (10/10 tasks, 13 contract tests)
- ðŸ“‹ M3 UI & E2E Tests (0/10 tasks) - Next
- **129 tests passing** (116 unit + 13 contract, 287% of M0-M2 target)
- **All 3 sample emails from test brief working** (inline tags, XML islands, error handling)
- All ADRs documented (10 total)
- Progress tracking system with duration metrics

**Implemented Components**:
- .NET 8 solution with Clean Architecture layers (Api, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)
- React 19 + Vite + TypeScript frontend with functional parsing UI
- **Tag validator** with stack-based validation
- **XML island extractor** with DTD/XXE protection
- **Tax calculator** with Banker's Rounding (MidpointRounding.ToEven)
- **Number normalizer** (handles commas, decimals)
- **Time parser** for time expressions
- **Content router** for processor selection (Expense vs Other)
- **Expense processor** with full parsing pipeline (Validate â†’ Extract â†’ Normalize â†’ Persist â†’ BuildResponse)
- **Error handling** with structured error responses (MISSING_TOTAL, INVALID_TAG, etc.)
- **RESTful API** with Swagger documentation at `/swagger`

Refer to `project-context/build-logs/BUILDLOG.md` for detailed progress history and `project-context/implementation/PROGRESS.md` for current status.

## Quick Start (Running the Application)

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK (version 8.0.414)
- Node.js 18+
- Git

**CRITICAL - .NET Path Configuration**: dotnet is installed at `/home/adarsh/.dotnet/dotnet` and requires PATH setup.

Add to `~/.bashrc` (permanent):
```bash
export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
export PATH="$DOTNET_ROOT:$PATH"
```

Or prefix commands (temporary):
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet:$PATH" && dotnet build
```

### 1. Backend API
```bash
# From project root
export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet:$PATH"
dotnet run --project src/Api
# API runs on http://localhost:5000
# Swagger UI at http://localhost:5000/swagger
```

### 2. Frontend (in new terminal)
```bash
# From project root
cd client
npm install  # First time only
npm run dev
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Verify
1. Open http://localhost:5173 in browser
2. Paste sample expense text in textarea
3. Click "Parse" button
4. Verify parsed expense data appears with correlation ID

**Sample Test Input** (from test brief):
```
Sample 1 (XML Island):
Hi Yvaine, Please create an expense claim for the below. Relevant details are:
<expense><cost_centre>DEV002</cost_centre><total>1024.01</total><payment_method>personal card</payment_method></expense>

Sample 2 (Inline Tags):
Hi Yvaine, Please create an expense claim. <vendor>Mojo Coffee</vendor> <total>120.50</total> <payment_method>personal card</payment_method>

Sample 3 (Error - Missing Total):
Hi Yvaine, Please create an expense claim. <vendor>Starbucks</vendor> <payment_method>personal card</payment_method>
â†’ Returns 400 Bad Request with MISSING_TOTAL error code
```

## Development Commands

### Backend (.NET 8)
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Always export PATH first
export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet:$PATH"

# Build solution
dotnet build

# Run API (http://localhost:5000)
dotnet run --project src/Api

# Run with hot reload
dotnet watch --project src/Api

# Run all tests (129 currently: 116 unit + 13 contract)
dotnet test

# Run specific test category
dotnet test --filter Category=Unit
dotnet test --filter Category=Contract

# Run specific test by name pattern
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TestName"

# Run single test file
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TagValidatorTests"

# Database migrations (when EF Core is configured)
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName --project src/Infrastructure
dotnet ef database update --project src/Api
```

### Frontend (React + Vite)
```bash
cd client

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Run dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run E2E tests (M3 milestone - not yet implemented)
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific E2E test
npx playwright test path/to/test.spec.ts
```

### Common Development Scenarios

**Port conflict (address already in use)**:
```bash
# Find process using port 5000 (backend)
lsof -i :5000
kill -9 <PID>

# Find process using port 5173 (frontend)
lsof -i :5173
kill -9 <PID>
```

**CORS issues** (frontend can't reach backend):
- Verify backend is running at http://localhost:5000
- Check `src/Api/Program.cs` has CORS policy configured
- Frontend is configured for http://localhost:5173 in CORS policy

**Tests failing after code changes**:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
dotnet clean
dotnet build
dotnet test --no-build
```

### MCP Servers & Tools

This project uses **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** for enhanced development capabilities:

#### Serena MCP (Semantic Code Analysis)
**Status**: âœ… Configured and indexed (as of M0 completion)
**Purpose**: Semantic code navigation, refactoring, and symbol-based editing for C# codebase

**When to Use**:
- âœ… Exploring code structure (classes, methods, interfaces)
- âœ… Finding all references to a symbol across the project
- âœ… Refactoring (renaming, changing signatures)
- âœ… Editing code by symbol (not line numbers)
- âœ… Understanding dependencies and call chains

**Key Tools**:
```bash
# Symbol exploration
Get symbols overview for src/Domain/Services/TaxCalculator.cs
Find symbol "TaxCalculator/CalculateFromInclusive" with include_body=true
Find all references to "ITaxCalculator"

# Code editing
Replace symbol body "ExpenseProcessor/ProcessAsync" with [new implementation]
Insert after symbol "TaxCalculator/CalculateFromInclusive" [new method]

# Project memory
Write a memory "architecture-notes" with [content]
List all memories
```

**Setup**:
- Project indexed at `.serena/cache/` (gitignored)
- Configuration in `.serena/project.yml`
- Language: C#, 20+ tools available
- See `project-context/learnings/serena-mcp-guide.md` for comprehensive guide

**Re-indexing** (when code symbols change):
- **Automatic**: Triggered by `update-progress.sh <task_id> completed` (runs in background, non-blocking)
- **Manual**: Run `./scripts/reindex-serena.sh` when needed (foreground, immediate)
- **When needed**: After adding new classes, methods, or interfaces; renaming symbols
- **When NOT needed**: After editing method bodies, changing strings/comments, running tests
- **Performance**: Background indexing completes in ~10-30 seconds without blocking workflow

**Best Practices**:
- Start with `get_symbols_overview` before reading full files
- Use `find_symbol` with `depth=1` to see class methods
- Find references before refactoring
- Prefer symbol editing over line-based editing

---

#### Context7 MCP (Library Documentation)
**Purpose**: Fetch up-to-date documentation for libraries and frameworks

**When to Use**:
- Looking up .NET, React, or other library APIs
- Need current documentation (beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff)
- Understanding library-specific patterns

**Usage**:
```
Get documentation for Entity Framework Core migrations
Get docs for React Query useQuery hook
```

---

#### Playwright MCP (Browser Automation & Testing)
**Purpose**: Browser automation for E2E testing and web interaction

**When to Use**:
- âœ… Writing/debugging E2E tests (M3 milestone)
- âœ… Testing UI flows in the browser
- âœ… Verifying form submissions, navigation, API responses
- âœ… Taking screenshots for debugging
- âœ… Inspecting console errors and network requests

**Key Tools**:
```bash
# Navigation
Navigate to http://localhost:3000
Take screenshot of current page

# Interaction
Click on element (e.g., submit button)
Type text into input field
Fill form with multiple fields

# Verification
Get page snapshot (accessibility tree)
Get console messages
Get network requests
Wait for text to appear/disappear

# Session management
List/create/close/select browser tabs
```

**Usage Example (E2E Test Flow)**:
```
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Take snapshot to verify page structure
3. Type sample expense text into textarea
4. Click "Parse" button
5. Wait for response
6. Verify parsed expense data appears
7. Take screenshot of results
```

**Best for M3**: Writing the 5+ E2E tests required for submission.

---

#### IDE MCP (VS Code Integration)
**Purpose**: Language diagnostics and code execution

**Tools**:
- `getDiagnostics`: Get compiler errors/warnings from VS Code
- `executeCode`: Run code in Jupyter kernels (for notebooks)

---

### Progress Tracking
```bash
# Start a task (updates tasks.json, PROGRESS.md)
./scripts/update-progress.sh task_001 in_progress

# Complete a task
./scripts/update-progress.sh task_001 completed

# Complete with test counts
./scripts/update-progress.sh task_014 completed unit 7

# Block a task
./scripts/update-progress.sh task_015 blocked

# Query current status
jq '.progress_tracking' project-context/implementation/tasks/tasks.json

# Check milestone progress
jq '.progress_tracking.milestones_completed' project-context/implementation/tasks/tasks.json

# View progress dashboard
cat project-context/implementation/PROGRESS.md
```

**Workflow**: Use `update-progress.sh` before/after each task. Script automatically:
- Updates `tasks.json` with status and timestamps
- **Tracks task duration** (started_at, completed_at, duration_minutes calculated automatically)
- Updates `PROGRESS.md` checkboxes and metrics
- Appends to `BUILDLOG.md` for milestone gates (task_010, 030, 040, 050)
- Triggers background Serena re-indexing for semantic code analysis
- Suggests commit messages

**Duration Tracking**:
- `started_at`: ISO timestamp when task marked in_progress
- `completed_at`: ISO timestamp when task marked completed
- `duration_minutes`: Auto-calculated on completion (rounded to nearest minute)
- Query duration metrics: `jq '.tasks[] | select(.duration_minutes != null) | {id, name, duration_minutes}' project-context/implementation/tasks/tasks.json`

See `project-context/implementation/TRACKING-WORKFLOW.md` for complete workflow documentation.

### Slash Commands (AADF-Compliant Git Workflow)

This project includes custom slash commands for AADF-compliant commits:

```bash
# Execute prompts from a file (for complex multi-step tasks)
/aadf-prompt-file path/to/instructions.md

# Create AADF-compliant commit from all changes (auto-stages everything)
/aadf-commit "description of changes made"

# Create AADF-compliant commit from staged files only
/aadf-commit-staged "description of staged changes"
```

**When to Use**:
- `/aadf-commit`: After completing a task with multiple file changes
- `/aadf-commit-staged`: When you want fine-grained control over what's committed
- Both commands use conventional commits syntax and include Claude Code co-authorship footer

**Example**:
```bash
# After implementing tax calculator
/aadf-commit "implement ITaxCalculator with Banker's Rounding"
```

## Architecture

**Style**: Clean/Hexagonal Architecture with CQRS-lite approach

### Backend Structure (.NET 8)
```
/src
  Api/            â†’ Endpoints, DI registration, Swagger, Middleware
  Application/    â†’ Commands/Queries, Validators, Handlers (CQRS)
  Domain/         â†’ Parsers, Value Objects, Calculators, Interfaces (Ports)
  Infrastructure/ â†’ EF Core, Repositories (Adapters), Logging, Config
/contracts/       â†’ Request/Response DTOs shared with tests
```

### Frontend Structure (React + Vite + TypeScript)
```
/client
  /src
    /components   â†’ UI components
    /api          â†’ API client/fetch wrappers
    /types        â†’ TypeScript interfaces
```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Processor selection (ExpenseProcessor vs OtherProcessor) based on content classification
- **Pipeline Pattern**: Within each processor (Validate â†’ Extract â†’ Normalize â†’ Persist â†’ BuildResponse)
- **Repository Pattern**: Data persistence abstraction
- **Ports & Adapters**: All external dependencies (DB, parsers) behind interfaces

### Critical Components (Implemented)

**Domain Layer** (`src/Domain/`):
- `ITagValidator` / `TagValidator`: Stack-based tag integrity validation (rejects unclosed tags)
- `IXmlIslandExtractor` / `XmlIslandExtractor`: Secure XML parsing (DTD/XXE disabled)
- `IContentRouter` / `ContentRouter`: Routes content to appropriate processor
- `ITaxCalculator` / `TaxCalculator`: Computes GST (tax-inclusive to exclusive conversion)
- `NumberNormalizer`: Normalizes numbers (handles commas, decimals)
- `ITimeParser` / `TimeParser`: Parses time expressions
- `IRoundingHelper` / `RoundingHelper`: Banker's Rounding (MidpointRounding.ToEven)
- `IContentProcessor` / `ExpenseProcessor`: Complete expense parsing pipeline

**Models** (`src/Domain/Models/`):
- `Expense`: Domain entity for expense data
- `ParsedContent`: Result of content parsing
- `TaxCalculationResult`: GST calculation output
- `XmlIsland`: Extracted XML data structure
- `ProcessingResult`: Generic processing result wrapper

**Exceptions** (`src/Domain/Exceptions/`):
- `ValidationException`: Custom exception for validation failures

**API Layer** (`src/Api/`):
- `ParseEndpoint`: Single POST endpoint at `/api/v1/parse`
- `Program.cs`: DI registration, Swagger configuration, middleware setup

## Implementation Workflow

### Task-Based Execution System
The project uses a **50-task decomposition system** with 4 milestone gates (M0, M1, M2, M3):

**Milestone Structure**:
- **M0: Minimal Scaffold** (10 tasks, 4 hours) - âœ… Complete
- **M1: Core Parsing & Validation** (20 tasks, 1 day) - âœ… Complete (116 unit tests)
- **M2: API Contracts** (10 tasks, 4 hours) - âœ… Complete (13 contract tests)
- **M3: UI & E2E Tests** (10 tasks, 4 hours) - ðŸ“‹ Next (Enhanced UI, 5+ E2E tests, **SUBMITTABLE**)

**Task Files**: Each task has a JSON file at `project-context/implementation/tasks/task_XXX.json` containing:
- Full context (PRD sections, ADRs, dependencies)
- Deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Agent assignment and estimated duration
- Traceability to specifications

**Task Execution**:
1. Read task file: `project-context/implementation/tasks/task_XXX.json`
2. Check dependencies in `tasks.json`
3. Mark in-progress: `./scripts/update-progress.sh task_XXX in_progress`
4. Execute following acceptance criteria (use specialized agent if assigned)
5. Run tests and verify deliverables
6. Mark completed: `./scripts/update-progress.sh task_XXX completed [test_type] [count]`
7. Commit implementation, then progress files separately

**Parallel Execution**: Some tasks can run concurrently (defined in `tasks.json` dependencies).

**Milestone Gates**: task_010, task_030, task_040, task_050 verify DoD completion and update BUILDLOG.

### TDD Workflow
**M1 uses strict TDD cycles** (RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR):
- Tag Validation: task_014 (RED) â†’ task_015 (GREEN) â†’ task_016 (REFACTOR)
- Number Normalization: task_017 (RED) â†’ task_018 (GREEN)
- Banker's Rounding: task_019 (RED) â†’ task_020 (GREEN)
- Tax Calculator: task_021 (RED) â†’ task_022 (GREEN)
- Time Parser: task_023 (RED) â†’ task_024 (GREEN)
- XML Extractor: task_025 (RED) â†’ task_026 (GREEN)
- Content Router: task_027 (RED) â†’ task_028 (GREEN)
- Expense Processor: task_029 (RED) â†’ task_030 (GREEN + M1 DoD)

**Test Coverage Targets** (ADR-0010):
- Unit tests: 30+ (M1)
- Contract tests: 10+ (M2)
- E2E tests: 5+ (M3)
- **Total: 45+ tests** for submission

## Development Methodology

### TDD/BDD Approach
- **Prioritize happy path first**, then core edge cases
- Avoid over-engineering; keep tests reasonable
- Use xUnit + FluentAssertions (.NET), Playwright (React E2E)

### Code Principles
- Follow SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI
- Simple, maintainable, extensible over complex
- Verify against specification before implementing
- Ensure type safety: align database schema, application types, and TypeScript interfaces

### Evidence-Based Decisions
- Check implementation against specification documents
- Read existing tests to understand application behavior
- Verify what has been implemented vs. what needs implementation

## Key Configuration

### Tax & Currency Defaults
- Default tax rate: **0.15** (NZ GST)
- Default currency: **NZD**

### Validation Rules
- `<total>` (tax-inclusive) is **required** for expenses; reject if missing
- `<cost_centre>` is **optional**; default to `UNKNOWN` if absent
- Any unclosed tag â†’ **reject with 400 error**

### API Design
- Single endpoint: `POST /api/v1/parse`
- URI-based versioning (`/api/v1/`)
- Response includes correlation ID for traceability

## Documentation Standards

### Maintain Minimal, Purposeful Documentation
Balance between markdown guides and code commentsâ€”choose the most maintainable option for each context.

### Required Documentation
1. **ADRs** at `project-context/adr/` (10 total)
   - ADR-0001: Storage choice (SQLite local dev, Postgres production)
   - ADR-0002: Architecture style (Clean/Hexagonal + CQRS-lite)
   - ADR-0003: Processor Strategy pattern
   - ADR-0004: Swagger for API contract
   - ADR-0005: Versioning via URI
   - ADR-0006: API key authentication
   - ADR-0007: Response Contract Design (expense XOR other)
   - ADR-0008: Parsing and Validation Rules (stack-based tag validation)
   - ADR-0009: Tax Calculation with Banker's Rounding (MidpointRounding.ToEven)
   - ADR-0010: Test Strategy and Coverage (45+ tests: unit, contract, E2E)

2. **Build Log** at `project-context/build-logs/BUILDLOG.md`
   - Chronological order (oldestâ†’newest), append new entries to end
   - Date, changes made, rationale, issues, testing notes

3. **Specification Documents** at `project-context/specifications/`
   - Primary: `prd-technical_spec.md` (v0.3 - current)
   - Requirements: `project-context/requirements-and-analysis/Full Stack Engineer Test (Sen) V2.pdf`

4. **Implementation System** at `project-context/implementation/`
   - `tasks/tasks.json`: 50-task orchestration with dependencies and parallel execution groups
   - `tasks/task_XXX.json`: Individual task files with full context for agent execution
   - `PROGRESS.md`: Real-time progress dashboard with test counts and duration metrics
   - `TRACKING-WORKFLOW.md`: Progress tracking system documentation

**These are the key documents** â€” always reference these before planning or implementing tasks.

## Git Conventions

- Use **conventional commits** syntax: `<type>[scope]: <description>`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`
- Include co-authorship footer when using Claude Code:
  ```
  ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

  Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
  ```

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **.NET 8** (Minimal API)
- **xUnit** + **FluentAssertions** (Testing)
- **FluentValidation** (Request validation)
- **Serilog** (Structured logging with correlation IDs)
- **Entity Framework Core** (ORM)
- **SQLite** (Local development database)
- **PostgreSQL** (Production database on Render)
- **Swashbuckle** (Swagger/OpenAPI documentation)

### Frontend
- **React 19**
- **Vite** (Build tool)
- **TypeScript** (Type safety)
- **Playwright** (E2E testing - M3 milestone)

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Render (free tier)
- **Database**: Render PostgreSQL (free tier)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Render integration (planned)

## Specification Scope

This is a **Phase 1, minimal viable product** demonstrating:
- End-to-end SDLC/DevOps understanding
- Clean architecture and cross-cutting concerns
- Practical simplicity balanced with broad technical thinking

**Out of Scope**: Phase 2 features (reservation processing), advanced auth, complex reporting.

## Key Verification Points

Before implementing:
1. Check specification: `project-context/specifications/prd-technical_spec.md` (v0.3)
2. Review existing tests to understand current behavior
3. Check BUILDLOG.md for implementation history and context
4. Ensure alignment: DB schema â†” domain models â†” DTOs â†” TypeScript types

When completing work:
1. Update progress: `./scripts/update-progress.sh <task_id> completed`
2. Update `BUILDLOG.md` with changes, rationale, testing notes
3. Create/update ADRs for architectural decisions
4. Run tests and verify type safety end-to-end
5. Commit implementation and progress files separately

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

### React-Specific Rules
- Use Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Leverage TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Implement React Query or simple fetch wrappers for API state management
- Follow component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Use Playwright for E2E testing with user-centric test scenarios
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management)

### .NET Core API-Specific Rules
- Use .NET 8 with Minimal APIs or Controllers (prefer Minimal APIs for simplicity)
- Implement FluentValidation for request validation
- Use FluentAssertions in xUnit tests for readable test assertions
- Configure Serilog for structured logging with correlation IDs
- Apply EF Core migrations for database schema changes
- Implement Ports (interfaces) in Domain, Adapters (implementations) in Infrastructure
- Register all dependencies via DI in Program.cs
- Use async/await throughout for I/O operations
- Expose Swagger UI at `/swagger` in development environment
