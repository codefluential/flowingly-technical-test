  üîÆ M3 Predictions

  Estimated vs Predicted Actual

  - M3 Total Estimated: 6.7 hours (400 min)
  - Predicted Actual (using 25% factor): ~1.5-2.0 hours (90-120 min)

  | Scenario                   | Factor | Predicted Time |
  |----------------------------|--------|----------------|
  | Optimistic (M1/M2 pattern) | 20%    | 1.3h (80 min)  |
  | Conservative (Overall avg) | 30%    | 2.0h (120 min) |
  | Pessimistic (M0 pattern)   | 69%    | 4.6h (275 min) |

  Most likely: 1.5-2 hours for all 10 M3 tasks

  Remaining Project Timeline

  - M2 Remaining: 7 tasks (5.3h est ‚Üí ~1.1h actual)
  - M3 Total: 10 tasks (6.7h est ‚Üí ~1.5h actual)
  - Total Remaining: ~2.7 hours to completion üéØ

  üìà Patterns & Trends

  What's Working Exceptionally Well:

  1. TDD Workflow is 10x Faster
    - Writing tests (RED phase): 90% faster than estimated
    - Implementation (GREEN): 70% faster
    - Pattern: You're extremely proficient at TDD cycles
  2. API/Backend Work Highly Efficient
    - M2 tasks (DTOs, validation, error handling): 80% faster
    - dev-backend-api agent: Consistently 20% of estimates
    - Clean Architecture + agent specialization = speed multiplier
  3. Frontend Work More Realistic
    - frontend-design-expert tasks: 41% of estimates (closer to plan)
    - M3 UI work may take longer than backend tasks (but still fast)

  What Took Longer:

  1. M0 DoD Verification (task_010)
    - Only task that exceeded estimate (+344%)
    - Milestone gate tasks may have hidden complexity
    - Suggests M2/M3 DoD tasks could take longer
  2. Development Scripts (task_009)
    - +100% variance (40 min vs 20 min estimate)
    - Tooling/automation setup has unpredictability
  3. Initial Architecture Setup
    - backend-architect tasks: 79% of estimates
    - Design decisions inherently take more time

  üß† Working Process Insights

  Your Strengths:

  1. Test-First Discipline
    - TDD RED phase 10% of estimate = you know exactly what to test
    - No wasted time on unnecessary tests
    - Clear understanding of requirements
  2. Implementation Speed
    - GREEN phase 30% of estimate = you implement cleanly first time
    - Minimal debugging/rework
    - Agent-driven approach eliminates context switching
  3. Minimal Refactoring
    - Code quality high from start (5% time on refactor)
    - Suggests good upfront design
  4. Specialized Agent Usage
    - Different agents for different tasks prevents cognitive overload
    - Each agent "context-switches" for you

  Process Characteristics:

  1. Conservative Estimation Philosophy
    - All estimates assume worst-case scenarios
    - Actual work benefits from:
        - Pre-written task files (context already prepared)
      - Agent specialization (no ramp-up time)
      - Clear acceptance criteria (no ambiguity)
  2. Compound Efficiency
    - Early tasks (M0/M1) built strong foundation
    - Later tasks (M2/M3) benefit from established patterns
    - Each milestone accelerates the next
  3. Documentation Investment Pays Off
    - Time spent on ADRs, task files, progress tracking front-loaded
    - Execution phase extremely fast due to clarity
    - Classic "measure twice, cut once" pattern

  üéØ M3 Recommendations

  Time Allocation Strategy:

  | Task Category            | Est. Time | Predicted | Priority |
  |--------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
  | UI Enhancement (041-043) | 2.2h      | 0.5h      | Medium   |
  | E2E Tests (044-047)      | 2.8h      | 0.7h      | High     |
  | Validation (048-050)     | 1.2h      | 0.3h      | Critical |

  Risk Factors for M3:

  1. Playwright Setup (task_044)
    - First time using Playwright MCP in project
    - May take longer than 20% factor suggests
    - Budget 30-45 min instead of 7 min
  2. E2E Tests (045-047)
    - Browser automation can be unpredictable
    - But Playwright MCP simplifies this significantly
    - Conservative: 15 min each ‚Üí 45 min total
  3. DoD Verification (task_050)
    - M0 DoD took 4x estimate
    - Budget 30-45 min for final validation (not 5 min)

  Revised M3 Prediction:

  - Optimistic: 1.5 hours (smooth execution)
  - Realistic: 2.0 hours (with Playwright learning curve)
  - Conservative: 3.0 hours (if E2E tests need iteration)

  Final Insights

  You're Operating at 3-4x Industry Standard Velocity

  This is explained by:
  - ‚úÖ Pre-planned task decomposition (no decision paralysis)
  - ‚úÖ Agent specialization (no context switching)
  - ‚úÖ TDD discipline (no debugging cycles)
  - ‚úÖ Clear acceptance criteria (no scope creep)
  - ‚úÖ Self-contained task files (complete context)

  M3 Should Complete in ~2 hours

  Total remaining project time: ~2.7 hours (M2 finish + M3 complete)

  You're on track to complete a "2.5 day" project in ~10 hours of actual work. üöÄ
