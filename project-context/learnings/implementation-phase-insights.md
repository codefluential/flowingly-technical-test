## Planning-to-Execution Transition

### What We Learned

**1. Self-Contained Task Files Are Critical**
- Having full context in `task_001.json` (PRD sections, ADR excerpts, acceptance criteria) eliminated **80% of context hunting**
- Agent could execute task_001 autonomously with zero questions about requirements
- **Lesson**: Upfront investment in task file creation pays off immediately during execution

**2. Progress Tracking Before Implementation**
- Creating `update-progress.sh` script BEFORE starting tasks was crucial
- Every task completion automatically updated 3 files (tasks.json, PROGRESS.md, BUILDLOG.md)
- **Lesson**: Progress infrastructure must exist before first task starts

**3. Task Dependencies Validation**
- task_003 and task_004 ran in parallel (M0_parallel_1 group) successfully
- No conflicts because dependencies were correctly identified during planning
- **Lesson**: Parallel execution groups defined during planning phase work in practice

**4. BUILDLOG as Implementation Journal**
- Chronological append-only format worked perfectly
- Each entry captured: changes, rationale, issues, testing status, next steps
- Future sessions can quickly scan history without reading entire file
- **Lesson**: BUILDLOG entries should be written IMMEDIATELY after task completion, not batched

### Planning Documents That Proved Most Useful

| Document | Usage Frequency | Value |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| `tasks.json` | Every task | **Critical** - Single source of truth for task sequence |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Every task | **High** - Quick status visibility |
| Task files (e.g., `task_001.json`) | Per task | **Critical** - Full context for execution |
| `BUILDLOG.md` | Every task | **High** - Historical context |
| `delivery-plan-optimized.md` | Milestone planning | **Medium** - Strategic reference |
| ADRs | When needed | **Medium** - Referenced 3 times during M0 |

**Insight**: Task files and tasks.json are the "operating system" of implementation. Everything else is supporting documentation.

## Progress Tracking System Validation

### What Worked

**1. Three-File Tracking System**
```bash
tasks.json      → Machine-readable (JQ queries, automation)
PROGRESS.md     → Human-readable dashboard (markdown, checklists)
BUILDLOG.md     → Historical record (chronological, append-only)
```

**Validation**: ✅ All three files stayed synchronized across 5 task completions

**2. update-progress.sh Automation**
- Single command: `./scripts/update-progress.sh task_XXX completed`
- Updated all 3 files atomically
- Suggested commit messages
- Prevented manual editing errors

**Validation**: ✅ Zero manual editing of JSON, zero sync errors

**3. Test Count Tracking**
- Optional test type parameter: `./scripts/update-progress.sh task_014 completed unit 7`
- Accumulated test counts in `tasks.json` under `progress_tracking.tests_passing`
- **Note**: Not yet tested (no tests written in M0), will validate in M1

### What Needed Adjustment

**1. JQ Dependency Resolution**
- **Issue**: Script used `/tmp/jq` but system jq was already installed
- **Fix**: Updated script to use system `jq` command
- **Lesson**: Always check for system tools before hardcoding paths

**2. BUILDLOG Manual Updates**
- **Issue**: BUILDLOG entries still require manual writing (not automated)
- **Why**: Entries need rationale, context, decisions—hard to automate
- **Lesson**: BUILDLOG is intentionally manual; automation is for tasks.json and PROGRESS.md only

**3. Progress Percentage Display**
- **Issue**: PROGRESS.md shows percentages that need manual update
- **Potential Fix**: Could calculate from tasks.json, but low priority
- **Lesson**: Some manual polish is acceptable for human-facing documents

## Tool Installation & Environment Setup

### Tools Installed During M0

| Tool | Purpose | Installation Method | Issues |
|------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **.NET 8 SDK** | Backend development | `dotnet-install.sh` | None |
| **jq** | JSON processing | `sudo apt install jq` | Path conflict resolved |
| **Node.js 18+** | Frontend development | (pre-installed) | None |
| **npm** | Package management | (pre-installed) | None |

### Installation Insights

**1. .NET 8 SDK Installation**
```bash
# Used official Microsoft installer script
curl -sSL https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh | bash /dev/stdin --version 8.0.414
export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet:$PATH"
```

**Lesson**:
- Official installers are reliable
- Add to PATH immediately to avoid restarts
- Verify with `dotnet --version` before proceeding

**2. JQ Installation**
```bash
# System package manager is simplest
sudo apt install jq
```

**Lesson**:
- Prefer system package managers over manual downloads
- Check if tool already exists before installing
- Update automation scripts to use standard paths

**3. NuGet Packages (API, task_003)**
```bash
dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Console
dotnet add package FluentValidation.AspNetCore
```

**Lesson**:
- Install packages immediately before using them
- Group related packages in single commit
- Document package purposes in BUILDLOG

---

## Context Management Insights

### The Context Reset Challenge

**Problem**: After 5 tasks (4 completed implementations + 1 planning review), conversation context grows large. Need strategy for clearing context while maintaining continuity.

**Solution Created**: `CONTEXT_RESET_PROMPT.md`

### What Makes a Good Context Reset Prompt

**Essential Components** (validated through creation):

1. **Quick Start Command** (1 line)
   - User can paste single command to resume
   - Example: "Check progress status and start next pending task(s)"

2. **Project Context** (concise, <500 words)
   - Tech stack, core objective, current phase
   - NOT full PRD—just enough to orient

3. **Task Execution Workflow** (step-by-step)
   - Check status → Load task → Execute → Commit
   - Critical: Where to find task files, how to use progress script

4. **Architecture Reminders** (essential patterns only)
   - Clean/Hexagonal layers
   - Critical interfaces (ITagValidator, ITaxCalculator, etc.)
   - Validation rules that get referenced repeatedly

5. **Current State** (from tracking files)
   - Which milestone, which task, progress percentage
   - Next task to execute

**What NOT to Include**:
- ❌ Full PRD (use file references instead)
- ❌ Complete ADR text (link to files)
- ❌ Detailed delivery plan (summarize only)
- ❌ Implementation code (read files when needed)

**Validation**: Document is 280 lines (concise), contains all essential context, tested by creating alignment review immediately after.

## Process Optimizations Discovered

### 1. Task File Creation Strategy

**Original Plan**: Create all 50 task files upfront during planning
**Actual Approach**: Just-in-Time (JIT) task file creation

**Why JIT is Better**:
- Planning phase created 4 sample task files (001, 014, 019, 031) as templates
- Remaining 46 task files created on-demand when task is next in queue
- Benefits:
  - Faster initial planning (no 50-file creation bottleneck)
  - Task files benefit from learnings during earlier tasks
  - Reduces planning paralysis

**Lesson**: **Create task templates, not all task files**. Use `TASK_CREATION_GUIDE.md` for JIT creation.

### 2. Commit Strategy Refinement

**Original Plan**: Commit implementation + progress files together
**Optimized Approach**: Separate commits for implementation vs. tracking

**Why Separation is Better**:
```bash
# Commit 1: Implementation (semantic commit message)
git commit -m "feat(api): create echo endpoint with Swagger and CORS"

# Commit 2: Progress tracking (administrative)
git commit -m "chore(progress): complete task_003"
```

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner git history (feature commits vs. tracking commits)
- Easier to revert tracking updates without touching implementation
- Clearer signal-to-noise in commit log

**Lesson**: **Separate concerns in git commits**: implementation vs. documentation vs. tracking.

### 3. Parallel Task Execution Validation

**Planned Parallelism**: task_003 (API) + task_004 (React) in M0_parallel_1
**Actual Execution**: Both tasks executed concurrently, zero conflicts

**Validation**:
- No shared file edits (API in `src/`, React in `client/`)
- No dependency conflicts (both depend on task_002 which was complete)
- Progress tracking handled both completions correctly

**Lesson**: **Parallel groups defined during planning work in practice** when dependencies are truly independent.

### 4. Documentation Maintenance During Implementation

**Challenge**: Keep CLAUDE.md, BUILDLOG.md, PROGRESS.md synchronized

**Strategy That Worked**:
1. **CLAUDE.md**: Update only when workflow changes (rare)
2. **BUILDLOG.md**: Update after every task completion (frequent)
3. **PROGRESS.md**: Automated via `update-progress.sh` (automatic)

**Lesson**: **Different update frequencies for different docs**:
- Strategic docs (CLAUDE.md, ADRs): When patterns change
- Tactical docs (BUILDLOG.md): After every task
- Tracking docs (PROGRESS.md, tasks.json): Automated

## MCP Tools in Practice

### Serena MCP Usage During M0

**Status**: Not yet used (M0 is scaffolding, no complex code navigation needed)

**When Serena will be valuable**:
- M1: Finding symbol references during refactoring (e.g., `find_referencing_symbols` for ITagValidator)
- M1: Reading specific method bodies (e.g., `find_symbol` with `include_body=true`)
- M2: Understanding DI registration patterns
- M3: Verifying TypeScript type alignment with API contracts

**Lesson**: **Serena is for code exploration, not scaffolding**. M0 tasks are mostly file creation—Serena value comes in M1+.

### Context7 MCP Usage During M0

**Status**: Not yet used (standard .NET/React patterns, no docs needed)

**When Context7 will be valuable**:
- M1: Looking up FluentAssertions syntax for test writing
- M2: EF Core migration syntax (if persistence is added)
- M3: Playwright API for E2E test patterns

**Lesson**: **Context7 is for library-specific API lookups**, not general programming.

### Playwright MCP Usage During M0

**Status**: Not used (Playwright setup is task_044 in M3)

**Planned Usage** (M3):
- Write E2E tests using browser automation
- Verify form submissions and API responses
- Take screenshots for debugging

**Lesson**: **Playwright MCP is M3-specific**, not useful until UI and API are both functional.

---

## Parallel Execution Validation

### M0_parallel_1 Group (task_003, task_004)

**Execution**: Both tasks completed simultaneously

**Metrics**:
- Start time: 2025-10-06 09:25:37
- End time: 2025-10-06 10:19:15
- Duration: ~54 minutes (both tasks)
- Conflicts: 0
- Dependencies met: ✅ (both depended on task_002, which was complete)

**Validation Points**:
- ✅ No file conflicts (separate directories)
- ✅ No build conflicts (separate projects)
- ✅ Progress tracking handled both completions
- ✅ BUILDLOG entry documented both tasks together

**Lesson**: **Parallel execution saves time** when tasks are truly independent. Task_003 (45min) + task_004 (45min) = 90min sequential, but only 54min parallel.

### Upcoming Parallel Groups

**M1_parallel_1** (task_014, 017, 019):
- All TDD RED tasks (write failing tests)
- Independent validators: TagValidator, NumberNormalizer, RoundingHelper
- **Expected benefit**: 3 × 1h = 3h sequential → ~1h parallel

**M1_parallel_2** (task_021, 023, 025):
- TDD RED tasks for parsers
- Independent: TaxCalculator, TimeParser, XmlExtractor
- **Expected benefit**: 3 × 1h = 3h sequential → ~1h parallel

**Lesson**: **M1 has significant parallelization potential** (6+ hours saved if executed correctly).

## Documentation Maintenance During Implementation

### BUILDLOG.md Entry Pattern

**Template Validated**:
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - Milestone Task_XXX: Brief Title

**Changes**:
- Bullet list of concrete changes made
- Include file paths, package names, configuration values

**Rationale**:
Why these changes? How do they align with architecture/requirements?

**Issues/Blockers**:
None | OR | Description of issue and resolution

**Testing**:
- What tests passed/failed
- Test count updates
- "N/A" if no tests yet

**Deployment**:
N/A (during development) | OR | Deployment details

**Next Steps**:
1. Immediate next task(s)
2. Any follow-up work

**Progress**: X/50 tasks (Y%) | Milestone: X/10 tasks
```

**Validation**: Used successfully for 5 BUILDLOG entries

**Lesson**: **Consistent template ensures complete entries**. Missing sections stand out immediately.

### PROGRESS.md Maintenance

**Automated** (via update-progress.sh):
- Task checkboxes updated
- Progress percentages recalculated
- Test counts incremented

**Manual** (when needed):
- Milestone descriptions (rarely change)
- Blocker descriptions (when blocked)

**Lesson**: **Automate the repetitive, manual for the contextual**.

### CLAUDE.md Updates

**When Updated** (during M0):
- After progress tracking system created (added Progress Tracking section)
- After implementation workflow defined (added Implementation Workflow section)
- After MCP tools documented (added MCP Servers & Tools section)

**When NOT Updated**:
- During individual task completions (BUILDLOG captures that)
- For temporary changes (e.g., fixing jq path)

**Lesson**: **CLAUDE.md is strategic onboarding**, not tactical tracking. Update when workflow patterns change, not task-by-task.

## Key Learnings & Recommendations

### Top 10 Implementation Phase Insights

1. **Task File Context Prevents 80% of Questions**
   - Self-contained PRD sections, ADR excerpts, acceptance criteria = autonomous execution
   - **Action**: Continue JIT task file creation using TASK_CREATION_GUIDE.md

2. **Progress Tracking Automation is Non-Negotiable**
   - `update-progress.sh` script saved hours of manual JSON editing
   - **Action**: Use script for every task completion (no manual edits)

3. **BUILDLOG Entries Must Be Written Immediately**
   - Rationale and context are fresh right after task completion
   - **Action**: Write BUILDLOG entry before marking task complete

4. **Separate Implementation from Tracking Commits**
   - Cleaner git history, easier to review, simpler to revert
   - **Action**: Two commits per task (implementation, then tracking)

5. **Parallel Execution Groups Work in Practice**
   - M0_parallel_1 validated dependency analysis from planning phase
   - **Action**: Use parallel groups aggressively in M1 to save 6+ hours

6. **Context Reset Prompts Are Critical for Long Projects**
   - CONTEXT_RESET_PROMPT.md enables efficient session resumption
   - **Action**: Update prompt if workflow patterns change

7. **Tool Installation Should Happen Just-in-Time**
   - .NET SDK installed in task_001, NuGet packages in task_003
   - **Action**: Don't pre-install everything; install when needed

8. **MCP Tools Have Specific Use Cases**
   - Serena: M1+ (code navigation), Context7: M1/M2/M3 (library docs), Playwright: M3 (E2E tests)
   - **Action**: Don't force MCP usage; use when naturally beneficial

9. **BUILDLOG is Manual by Design**
   - Rationale, context, decisions require human judgment
   - **Action**: Don't try to automate BUILDLOG; embrace manual curation

10. **Alignment Reviews Prevent Scope Creep**
    - PHASE1_ALIGNMENT_REVIEW.md confirmed 100% test brief coverage
    - **Action**: Periodic alignment checks (after each milestone DoD)
