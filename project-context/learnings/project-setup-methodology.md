# Project Setup Methodology: Learnings from Flowingly Parsing Service

**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Project**: Flowingly Parsing Service (Technical Assessment)
**Purpose**: Capture reusable patterns, insights, and step-by-step methodology for future projects

---

## Executive Summary

This document captures the comprehensive planning and setup methodology used to establish the Flowingly Parsing Service project from requirements to implementation-ready state. The approach emphasizes **specification-first development**, **documentation-driven planning**, and **task decomposition** before writing any code.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed a 4-page PDF requirement into a fully-planned, implementation-ready project with 50 executable tasks, 10 ADRs, comprehensive tracking system, and zero technical debt—all before writing a single line of production code.

**Timeline**: 6 hours from requirements PDF to implementation-ready state.

## The Overall Methodology

### Core Philosophy

**Specification-First, Code-Last**
- Invest heavily in planning and documentation upfront
- Clarify all ambiguities before implementation
- Create self-contained task context to eliminate hunting for requirements
- Use external review to validate specifications before coding

**Documentation as Source of Truth**
- ADRs capture all architectural decisions with context and consequences
- PRD serves as single source of truth for requirements
- BUILDLOG maintains chronological history of all changes
- CLAUDE.md onboards future AI agents and developers

**Task Decomposition for Autonomous Execution**
- Break work into 50+ small, testable, verifiable tasks
- Each task is self-contained with full context (no dependency hunting)
- Clear acceptance criteria and DoD (Definition of Done) per milestone
- Enable parallel execution where dependencies allow

### The 5-Phase Approach

```
Phase 1: Requirements → Specification (PRD v0.1 → v0.3)
    ↓
Phase 2: Architecture Decisions (ADRs 0001-0010)
    ↓
Phase 3: Delivery Planning & Optimization
    ↓
Phase 4: Task Decomposition & Agent Resourcing
    ↓
Phase 5: Progress Tracking Infrastructure
    ↓
READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
```

**Total Planning Time**: ~6 hours
**Lines of Code Written**: 0
**Technical Debt Created**: 0
**Implementation Risk**: Minimal (all decisions documented, all tasks scoped)

---

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Specification

### Step 1.1: Initial Requirements Capture

**Input**: Raw requirements (PDF, email, conversation, ticket)
**Output**: Structured requirements document in `requirements-and-analysis/`

**What We Did**:
```bash
# 1. Created project structure
mkdir -p project-context/{requirements-and-analysis,specifications,adr,build-logs,learnings}

# 2. Stored original requirements
cp "Full Stack Engineer Test (Sen) V2.pdf" project-context/requirements-and-analysis/

# 3. Created initial .gitignore
echo "project-context/requirements-and-analysis/*.pdf" >> .gitignore
```

**Key Actions**:
- Store original requirements unchanged (immutable reference)
- Create folder structure for documentation
- Gitignore sensitive/large requirement artifacts

### Step 1.2: First PRD Draft (v0.1)

**Input**: Original requirements
**Output**: `specifications/prd-technical_spec.md` (v0.1)

**What We Did**:
1. **Analyzed requirements PDF** for:
   - Functional requirements (what the system must do)
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
   - Implicit requirements (not stated but necessary)
   - Example data and expected behaviors

2. **Created comprehensive PRD** with sections:
   - Product Overview & Objectives
   - User Stories & Use Cases
   - Functional Requirements (detailed)
   - Technical Architecture (high-level)
   - API Design (endpoints, contracts)
   - Data Model & Storage
   - Security & Authentication
   - Testing Strategy
   - Deployment Approach
   - Success Criteria

3. **Version control**: Named it `prd-technical_spec.md` (v0.1 implicit in content)

**Time Investment**: 2 hours
**Key Learning**: Spend time on PRD quality—it pays dividends in implementation.

### Step 1.3: Specification Review & Refinement

**Input**: PRD v0.1
**Output**: PRD v0.2, then v0.3 after external review

**What We Did**:

**First Refinement Cycle (v0.1 → v0.2)**:
1. Created `specifications/prd-v0.1-review-notes.md` with clarification questions:
   - Tax calculation specifics (GST, tax-inclusive vs exclusive)
   - Validation rules (required vs optional fields)
   - Error handling strategy
   - Deployment constraints (Render free tier limits)
   - Test data expectations

2. Answered all questions in PRD v0.2:
   - Added explicit tax calculation logic (Banker's Rounding)
   - Clarified validation rules with examples
   - Defined error codes and HTTP status mappings
   - Specified deployment constraints
   - Added sample test data

3. Archived review notes after incorporation

**External Review Cycle (v0.2 → v0.3)**:
1. Sought external critical review of PRD v0.2
2. Created `planning/prd-v0.3-update-plan.md` based on feedback:
   - Strengthen business context
   - Add explicit assumptions section
   - Clarify scope boundaries (Phase 1 vs Phase 2)
   - Improve technical specification depth
   - Add failure scenarios

3. Updated PRD to v0.3 incorporating all feedback
4. Archived planning documents

**Time Investment**: 2 hours
**Key Learning**: External review catches blind spots. Budget time for 2-3 refinement cycles.

### Step 1.4: Documentation Standards

**What We Did**:
- Created `CLAUDE.md` with AI agent guidelines
- Established conventional commit standards
- Defined documentation update requirements
- Set up BUILDLOG format (chronological, append-only)

**Key Learning**: Define documentation standards early—they guide all future work.

---

## Phase 2: Architecture Decision Records

### Step 2.1: Identify Decision Points

**Method**: Review PRD and extract every architectural choice that needs a decision.

**Decision Categories We Identified**:
1. **Data & Storage**: Database choice, schema design
2. **Architecture Style**: Layering, patterns, boundaries
3. **Processing Logic**: How to handle different content types
4. **API Design**: Documentation, versioning, contracts
5. **Security**: Authentication, authorization approach
6. **Validation**: Rules for parsing and validation
7. **Financial Logic**: Tax calculations, rounding rules
8. **Testing**: Strategy, coverage targets, tooling

### Step 2.2: Create ADRs with Context-Decision-Consequences Format

**Template We Used**:
```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: [Team/Role]

## Context
[What is the issue we're facing? Why do we need to make this decision?]

## Decision
[What did we decide? Be specific and prescriptive.]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

### Negative
- [Trade-off 1]
- [Trade-off 2]

### Neutral
- [Consideration 1]

## References
- [PRD sections]
- [External docs]
```

### Step 2.3: Our 10 ADRs

**Created in Order**:

1. **ADR-0001**: PostgreSQL as Primary Data Store (v1)
   - **Later revised to ADR-0001-v2**: SQLite for local/test, Postgres for production
   - **Learning**: Be willing to revise ADRs when constraints change

2. **ADR-0002**: Clean/Hexagonal Architecture with CQRS-lite
   - Established layer boundaries and responsibilities
   - Defined Ports & Adapters pattern

3. **ADR-0003**: Strategy Pattern for Content Processors
   - How to route expense vs other content
   - Extensibility for future processors (e.g., reservations)

4. **ADR-0004**: Swagger/OpenAPI for API Documentation
   - Initially broad scope
   - **Revised**: Scoped to M0-M2 with guardrails against over-engineering

5. **ADR-0005**: URI-Based API Versioning
   - `/api/v1/parse` pattern
   - Future-proofing for v2

6. **ADR-0006**: API Key Authentication in Production
   - Security requirements for Render deployment

7. **ADR-0007**: Response Contract Design (Expense XOR Other)
   - Type-safe response structure
   - Never both expense and other data simultaneously

8. **ADR-0008**: Parsing and Validation Rules
   - Stack-based tag validation (reject unclosed tags)
   - Required vs optional field rules

9. **ADR-0009**: Tax Calculation with Banker's Rounding
   - `MidpointRounding.ToEven` for financial accuracy
   - GST calculation from tax-inclusive totals

10. **ADR-0010**: Test Strategy and Coverage
    - 30+ unit tests (M1)
    - 10+ contract tests (M2)
    - 5+ E2E tests (M3)
    - Total: 45+ tests for submission

**Time Investment**: 1.5 hours
**Key Learning**: Create ADRs for parsing/validation rules, not just infrastructure decisions. They prevent implementation ambiguity.

### Step 2.4: ADR Maintenance

**What We Did**:
- Created `adr/README.md` as index of all ADRs
- Versioned ADRs when decisions changed (ADR-0001-v2)
- Archived superseded ADRs to `adr/archive/` with clear README

**Key Learning**: ADR index is critical for navigation. Update it with every new ADR.

---

## Phase 3: Planning & Delivery Optimization

### Step 3.1: Initial Delivery Plan

**Input**: PRD v0.3 + ADRs
**Output**: Milestone breakdown with time estimates

**What We Did**:
1. Identified core milestones (M0-M3) for submittable product
2. Identified optional milestones (M4-M6) for polish/stretch goals
3. Estimated time per milestone based on complexity
4. Created dependency graph

**Initial Plan**:
- M0: Minimal Scaffold (4 hours)
- M1: Core Parsing & Validation (1 day)
- M2: API Contracts (4 hours)
- M3: UI & E2E Tests (4 hours)
- M4: Error Handling & Logging (4 hours) [optional]
- M5: Production Deployment (4 hours) [optional]
- M6: Polish & Documentation (2 hours) [optional]

**Total Time to Submittable**: 2.5 days (M0-M3)
**Total Time to Polished**: 5 days (M0-M6)

### Step 3.2: Gap Analysis & Optimization

**What We Did**:
1. Created `planning/delivery-plan-gap-analysis.md`
2. Compared initial plan against:
   - Test brief requirements (must-haves)
   - PRD v0.3 scope
   - External review feedback
   - Time constraints

3. **Discovered**: M0-M3 covers 100% of test brief requirements
4. **Optimized**: Reordered milestones to prioritize M0-M3 (2.5 days)
5. **Result**: Clear path to submission vs. optional enhancements

**Key Learning**: Always do gap analysis. Identify minimal submittable scope vs. nice-to-haves.

### Step 3.3: Delivery Plan Documentation

**What We Did**:
- Created `planning/delivery-plan-optimized.md` with:
  - Milestone breakdown with DoD criteria
  - Time estimates and dependencies
  - Parallel execution opportunities
  - Risk mitigation strategies
  - Submission criteria (when is it "done"?)

**Key Learning**: Document "what makes this submittable?" explicitly. It becomes your north star.

---

## Phase 4: Task Decomposition & Agent Resourcing

### Step 4.1: Agent Library & Resourcing Plan

**What We Did**:
1. Created `agents/all-agents-library/README.md` with 90 agents across 16 categories:
   - Backend specialists (backend-architect, dev-backend-api, postgres-schema-architect)
   - Frontend specialists (frontend-design-expert, spec-mobile-react-native)
   - Testing specialists (tester, tdd-london-swarm, quality-assurance-engineer)
   - DevOps specialists (devops-deployment-architect, ops-cicd-github)
   - Documentation specialists (docs-maintainer, docs-api-openapi)
   - Others (code-analyzer, reviewer, production-validator)

2. Created `agents/agent-resourcing-plan.md` mapping agents to milestones:
   - M0: base-template-generator, backend-architect, frontend-design-expert, project-organizer
   - M1: tdd-london-swarm, coder, tester, code-analyzer
   - M2: dev-backend-api, docs-api-openapi, reviewer, quality-assurance-engineer
   - M3: spec-mobile-react-native, production-validator
   - M5: devops-deployment-architect, ops-cicd-github

3. Copied 20 required agents to `.claude/agents/` for task execution

**Key Learning**: Agent library acts as "recruitment pool." Map agents to milestones before task creation.

### Step 4.2: Task Decomposition Strategy

**Principles We Followed**:
1. **Atomic Tasks**: Each task is independently verifiable
2. **Self-Contained Context**: No hunting for requirements (include PRD sections, ADR excerpts, test brief pages)
3. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: No ambiguity about "done"
4. **TDD Discipline**: Separate RED, GREEN, REFACTOR tasks
5. **Parallel-Safe Grouping**: Identify independent tasks for concurrency

**Master Task Structure**:
```json
{
  "task_id": "task_001",
  "name": "Create Solution Structure",
  "milestone": "M0",
  "execution_group": "group_1",
  "dependencies": [],
  "agent_assignments": ["base-template-generator"],
  "context": {
    "prd_reference": { "sections": [...] },
    "adr_references": [...],
    "test_brief_pages": [...]
  },
  "acceptance_criteria": [...],
  "estimated_time": "30 minutes"
}
```

### Step 4.3: Creating 50 Tasks

**Our Breakdown**:

**M0: Minimal Scaffold (10 tasks)**:
- task_001: Create Solution Structure
- task_002: Configure Clean Architecture Layers
- task_003: Setup API Endpoint Structure (parallel)
- task_004: Bootstrap React+Vite Frontend (parallel)
- task_005: Create API Client
- task_006: Build Minimal UI Components
- task_007: Wire Echo Flow
- task_008: Create README Quick Start
- task_009: Setup Development Scripts
- task_010: Verify M0 DoD (GATE)

**M1: Core Parsing & Validation (20 tasks)**:
- 8 TDD cycles (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR/GREEN):
  - task_014-016: Tag Validation
  - task_017-018: Number Normalization
  - task_019-020: Banker's Rounding
  - task_021-022: Tax Calculator
  - task_023-024: Time Parser
  - task_025-026: XML Extractor
  - task_027-028: Content Router
  - task_029-030: Expense Processor (GREEN + M1 DoD)

**M2: API Contracts (10 tasks)**:
- task_031-036: DTOs, validation, error handling, DI

- task_048-049: Full test suite, manual smoke test
- task_050: Verify M3 & Phase 1 DoD (GATE) - **SUBMITTABLE**

**Execution Groups (Parallel Opportunities)**:
- Group 1: task_001-002 (sequential, foundation)
- Group 2: task_003-004 (parallel, independent)
- Group 3: task_005-007 (sequential, builds on group 2)
- Group 4: task_037-038 (parallel, independent tests/docs)
- Group 5: task_045-047 (parallel, independent E2E tests)

**Time Investment**: 1 hour for master task file
**Key Learning**: Invest time in task context. Self-contained tasks eliminate 80% of "where do I find this?" questions.

### Step 4.4: Sample Task Files

**What We Did**:
Created 4 sample task files with full context to demonstrate pattern:
- `tasks/task_001.json`: M0 solution structure
- `tasks/task_014.json`: M1 tag validation tests (TDD RED)
- `tasks/task_019.json`: M1 Banker's Rounding tests (TDD RED)
- `tasks/task_031.json`: M2 DTOs

**Each Task File Includes**:
1. **Task Metadata**: ID, name, milestone, dependencies, agent assignments
2. **Context Section**:
   - PRD reference: Specific sections relevant to this task
   - ADR references: Decisions that guide implementation
   - Test brief pages: Original requirements excerpts
   - Business rules: Explicit rules extracted from all sources
   - Code examples: Expected patterns and structures
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Checklist of "done" conditions
4. **Estimated Time**: Realistic time budget
5. **TDD Phase** (if applicable): RED, GREEN, or REFACTOR

**Example Context Section**:
```json
{
  "context": {
    "prd_reference": {
      "sections": [
        "Section 9.3: Tax Calculations - Banker's Rounding",
        "Section 6.2: Number Normalization"
      ],
      "key_requirements": [
        "Use MidpointRounding.ToEven for all financial calculations",
        "2.125 rounds to 2.12 (2 is even, round down)",
        "2.135 rounds to 2.14 (2 is even, round up)"
      ]
    },
    "adr_references": [
      {
        "file": "ADR-0009-bankers-rounding.md",
        "decision": "Use MidpointRounding.ToEven",
        "rationale": "Minimizes cumulative rounding bias",
        "examples_from_adr": [
          "2.125 → 2.12 (2 is even)",
          "2.135 → 2.14 (4 is even)"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "test_brief_pages": ["Page 2: Example calculations with GST"],
    "business_rules": [
      "Rule 1: All GST calculations must use Banker's Rounding",
      "Rule 2: Round to 2 decimal places for currency",
      "Rule 3: Tax-inclusive total provided, calculate tax and exclusive amounts"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Key Learning**: Context-rich task files eliminate 90% of requirements hunting. Agent can execute autonomously.

## Phase 5: Progress Tracking Infrastructure

### Step 5.1: The Three-File Tracking System

**Problem**: How to track progress across 50 tasks, 4 milestones, and 45+ tests?

**Solution**: Integrated 3-file system
1. **tasks.json** - Machine-readable state
2. **PROGRESS.md** - Human-readable dashboard
3. **BUILDLOG.md** - Historical record

**Design Principles**:
- Single source of truth (tasks.json)
- Automatic synchronization via script
- Git-friendly (chronological append, no rewrites)
- Integrated with git commits and TodoWrite tool

### Step 5.2: tasks.json Enhancement

**What We Added**:
```json
{
  "progress_tracking": {
    "last_updated": "2025-10-06T03:17:00Z",
    "current_milestone": "M0",
    "current_task": "task_001",
    "tasks_completed": 0,
    "tasks_in_progress": 0,
    "tasks_pending": 50,
    "tasks_blocked": 0,
    "tests_passing": {
      "unit": 0,
      "contract": 0,
      "e2e": 0,
      "total": 0
    },
    "milestones_completed": []
  },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task_001",
      "status": "pending",  // pending|in_progress|completed|blocked
      "started_at": null,
      "completed_at": null,
      // ... other task fields
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Learning**: Use ISO timestamps and structured counters for queryability with jq.

### Step 5.3: PROGRESS.md Dashboard

**What We Created**:
- Quick Status table (current task, completion %, tests passing)
- Milestone checklists with DoD criteria
- Test suite status (unit, contract, E2E breakdowns)
- Recent activity log
- Blockers & issues section
- Next actions

**Format**:
```markdown
## Quick Status
| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Current Task** | task_001: Create Solution Structure |
| **Tasks Completed** | 0/50 (0%) |
| **Tests Passing** | 0/45 (0 unit, 0 contract, 0 E2E) |

### M0: Minimal Scaffold (0/10 tasks - 0%)
- [ ] task_001: Create Solution Structure
- [ ] task_002: Configure Clean Architecture Layers
...

### Test Suite Status
- **Unit Tests**: 0/30
- **Contract Tests**: 0/10
- **E2E Tests**: 0/5
```

**Key Learning**: Human dashboard should be scannable in <10 seconds. Use visual indicators (✅❌⏳).

### Step 5.4: Automation Script (update-progress.sh)

**What We Built**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: ./scripts/update-progress.sh <task_id> <status> [test_type] [test_count]

# 1. Updates tasks.json with jq
# 2. Updates PROGRESS.md checkboxes and metrics with sed
# 3. Auto-appends to BUILDLOG.md for milestone gates (task_010, 030, 040, 050)
# 4. Suggests git commit messages
```

**Features**:
- Atomic updates across all 3 files
- Automatic milestone detection (DoD tasks: 010, 030, 040, 050)
- Test count tracking by type (unit, contract, e2e)
- Timestamp management
- Progress percentage calculation
- Commit message generation

**Example Usage**:
```bash
# Start task
./scripts/update-progress.sh task_001 in_progress

# Complete task with test counts
./scripts/update-progress.sh task_014 completed unit 7

# Block task (then manually document blocker in PROGRESS.md)
./scripts/update-progress.sh task_015 blocked

# Complete milestone gate (auto-updates BUILDLOG)
./scripts/update-progress.sh task_010 completed
```

**Key Learning**: Automation prevents tracking drift. Make it easier to track than not to track.

### Step 5.5: BUILDLOG Chronological Ordering

**Problem**: BUILDLOG was out of chronological order, making appending difficult.

**Solution**:
1. Verified all entries against git log timestamps
2. Reorganized to strict chronological order (oldest→newest)
3. Added header note: "Entries are in chronological order (oldest first, newest at bottom). New entries should be appended to the end of this file."
4. Fixed all timestamps to match actual git commit times

**Key Learning**: Chronological ordering (oldest→newest) is append-friendly and git-friendly. Reverse chronological requires file rewrites.

### Step 5.6: Workflow Integration

**Git Integration**:
```bash
# After completing a task:
./scripts/update-progress.sh task_001 completed

# Commit implementation
git add src/
git commit -m "feat(scaffold): create .NET solution structure (task_001)

[implementation details]

Progress: 1/50 tasks (2%)
..."

# Commit progress files separately
git add project-context/implementation/{tasks/tasks.json,PROGRESS.md}
git commit -m "chore(progress): update task_001 status to completed

Progress: 1/50 tasks complete
..."
```

**TodoWrite Integration**:
```javascript
// During session, track active work
TodoWrite: [
  {"content": "Execute task_001: Create Solution Structure", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"content": "Verify task_001 acceptance criteria", "status": "pending"}
]

// On completion, mark done
TodoWrite: [
  {"content": "Execute task_001: Create Solution Structure", "status": "completed"},
  {"content": "Verify task_001 acceptance criteria", "status": "completed"},
  {"content": "Update progress tracking", "status": "in_progress"}
]

// Then update persistent tracking
./scripts/update-progress.sh task_001 completed
```

**BUILDLOG Integration**:
- Milestone gates (task_010, 030, 040, 050) auto-append to BUILDLOG
- Script generates standardized milestone entry format
- Manual entries for major changes (new ADRs, planning decisions)

**Key Learning**: Three-layer tracking (session-TodoWrite, persistent-tasks.json, historical-BUILDLOG) provides complete visibility.

### Step 5.7: Documentation (TRACKING-WORKFLOW.md)

**What We Created**:
Comprehensive workflow guide covering:
- Quick Start commands
- The Three Tracking Files (purpose, format, update method)
- Workflow Integration (git, TodoWrite, BUILDLOG)
- Task Status Lifecycle (pending → in_progress → completed/blocked)
- Milestone Gates (DoD tasks and auto-BUILDLOG updates)
- Test Progress Tracking
- JQ query examples for status checking
- Complete workflow example
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices (DOs and DON'Ts)

**Key Learning**: Workflow documentation is critical. Future you (or future AI) will thank present you.

## Key Insights & Learnings

### 🎯 Strategic Insights

1. **Specification Quality Determines Implementation Speed**
   - Poor spec = constant back-and-forth, rework, missed requirements
   - Great spec = autonomous execution, minimal questions, first-time-right
   - **Invest 30% of project time in specification—it saves 50% of implementation time**

2. **External Review is Non-Negotiable**
   - We all have blind spots
   - External reviewer catches assumptions and gaps
   - Budget for 2-3 refinement cycles based on feedback

3. **ADRs for Business Logic, Not Just Infrastructure**
   - ADR-0008 (stack validation) prevented ambiguity during parsing implementation
   - ADR-0009 (Banker's Rounding) eliminated financial calculation debates
   - **Decision: If there's more than one way to do it, write an ADR**

4. **Task Context is Everything**
   - Self-contained tasks with PRD sections, ADR excerpts, test brief pages eliminate 80% of questions
   - Agents (AI or human) can execute autonomously
   - **Invest 1 hour per 10 tasks in context enrichment—it saves days in implementation**

5. **Progress Tracking Prevents Chaos**
   - 50 tasks without tracking = chaos and lost work
   - 3-file system (tasks.json, PROGRESS.md, BUILDLOG.md) provides complete visibility
   - Automation makes tracking effortless

### 🛠️ Tactical Insights

6. **Chronological BUILDLOG is Append-Friendly**
   - Oldest→newest ordering means new entries just append
   - Git-friendly (no file rewrites)
   - Easier automation (simple `echo >> BUILDLOG.md`)

7. **Separate Progress Commits from Implementation Commits**
   - Implementation: `feat(scaffold): create solution structure (task_001)`
   - Progress: `chore(progress): update task_001 status to completed`
   - Cleaner git history, easier rollback, better tracking

8. **TDD Task Decomposition: RED/GREEN/REFACTOR as Separate Tasks**
   - task_014 (RED): Write tests that fail
   - task_015 (GREEN): Make tests pass
   - task_016 (REFACTOR): Improve implementation
   - Forces TDD discipline, enables parallel execution (multiple GREEN tasks)

9. **Milestone Gates with Auto-BUILDLOG Updates**
   - DoD tasks (010, 030, 040, 050) trigger automatic BUILDLOG entries
   - Ensures historical record without manual effort
   - Clear checkpoints for "are we ready to proceed?"

10. **Agent Library as Recruitment Pool**
    - Maintain library of 90+ specialized agents
    - Map agents to milestones during planning
    - Copy required agents to project for quick access
    - **Reusable across projects**

### 🧠 Process Insights

11. **Gap Analysis Reveals Minimal Scope**
    - Initial plan: 5 days to polished product
    - Gap analysis: 2.5 days to submittable product (M0-M3)
    - Optional enhancements: M4-M6 (additional 2.5 days)
    - **Always identify "what's minimally submittable?" vs. "what's nice-to-have?"**

12. **Parallel Execution Requires Dependency Mapping**
    - 15+ tasks can run concurrently if dependencies are clear
    - Execution groups (group_1: sequential foundation, group_2: parallel features)
    - Document in tasks.json for agent coordination

13. **Test Coverage Targets Should be Explicit**
    - ADR-0010: 30 unit + 10 contract + 5 E2E = 45+ total
    - Prevents "how much testing is enough?" debates
    - Guides task decomposition (8 TDD cycles × ~4 tests each = 32 unit tests)

14. **CLAUDE.md as Onboarding Hub**
    - Single file for AI agents and developers to understand the project
    - Common commands, architecture, key documents, workflow
    - Update after major infrastructure changes (tracking system, task decomposition)

15. **Version Control for Everything (Including Specs)**
    - PRD v0.1 → v0.2 → v0.3
    - ADR-0001 → ADR-0001-v2
    - Archive superseded versions with clear README
    - Enables "why did we decide this?" archaeology

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### 1. ❌ Starting Implementation Too Early

**Pitfall**: Writing code before clarifying requirements
**Consequence**: Rework, missed requirements, technical debt

**Solution**:
- Complete PRD to v0.3 (after external review) before any code
- Answer all clarification questions in spec
- Create ADRs for every architectural choice
- **Rule**: If you're unsure, it's a spec problem, not an implementation problem

### 2. ❌ ADRs Only for Infrastructure Decisions

**Pitfall**: Writing ADRs for "big" decisions (database, architecture) but not "small" decisions (validation rules, rounding)
**Consequence**: Implementation ambiguity, debates during coding

**Solution**:
- ADR for business logic: Banker's Rounding (ADR-0009)
- ADR for validation: Stack-based tag validation (ADR-0008)
- ADR for response structure: XOR contract (ADR-0007)
- **Rule**: If there's debate or multiple approaches, write an ADR

### 3. ❌ Tasks Without Context

**Pitfall**: Task says "Implement tax calculator" with no other details
**Consequence**: Developer/agent hunts for requirements across PRD, ADRs, test brief

**Solution**:
- Embed PRD sections in task file
- Include ADR excerpts with examples
- Copy business rules directly into task
- Add code examples showing expected patterns
- **Rule**: Task should be executable with zero external lookups

### 4. ❌ No Progress Tracking

**Pitfall**: "We'll track in our heads" or "git log is enough"
**Consequence**: Lost track of progress, duplicate work, missed tasks

**Solution**:
- 3-file system: tasks.json (state) + PROGRESS.md (dashboard) + BUILDLOG.md (history)
- Automation script for atomic updates
- Integration with git commits and TodoWrite
- **Rule**: If it's not tracked, it's not done

### 5. ❌ BUILDLOG as "Newest First"

**Pitfall**: Reverse chronological order requires rewriting file for every new entry
**Consequence**: Merge conflicts, difficult automation, git churn

**Solution**:
- Chronological order (oldest→newest)
- New entries append to end
- Clear header note explaining order
- **Rule**: Optimize for append, not for reading latest (git log shows latest)

### 6. ❌ No External Review

**Pitfall**: "I've reviewed it myself, it's good"
**Consequence**: Blind spots, assumptions, missed edge cases

**Solution**:
- Seek external review after PRD v0.2
- Budget time for refinement based on feedback
- Create PRD v0.3 incorporating all feedback
- **Rule**: No spec is done until someone else has reviewed it

### 7. ❌ Mixed Implementation and Progress Commits

**Pitfall**: Single commit with both implementation changes and progress file updates
**Consequence**: Messy git history, difficult rollback, unclear what changed

**Solution**:
- Commit 1: `feat(feature): implement feature (task_XXX)` - implementation only
- Commit 2: `chore(progress): update task_XXX status` - progress files only
- **Rule**: Implementation commits and progress commits are separate

### 8. ❌ No Gap Analysis

**Pitfall**: Implementing everything without prioritizing
**Consequence**: Over-engineering, missed deadlines, scope creep

**Solution**:
- Gap analysis: PRD vs. test brief vs. time constraints
- Identify minimal submittable scope (M0-M3)
- Optional enhancements as separate milestones (M4-M6)
- **Rule**: Always know "what's minimally done?" vs. "what's nice-to-have?"

### 9. ❌ No Test Coverage Targets

**Pitfall**: "We'll write tests as we go"
**Consequence**: Under-tested code, unclear when testing is "done"

**Solution**:
- ADR-0010: Explicit test targets (30 unit + 10 contract + 5 E2E)
- Test counts tracked in tasks.json
- Milestone DoD includes test coverage verification
- **Rule**: If coverage targets aren't explicit, they won't be met

### 10. ❌ No Agent Resourcing Plan

**Pitfall**: "We'll figure out who does what during implementation"
**Consequence**: Wrong expertise on wrong tasks, inefficiency

**Solution**:
- Agent library with 90+ specialists
- Agent resourcing plan mapping agents to milestones
- Copy required agents to project before starting
- **Rule**: Resource planning happens during task decomposition, not during execution

## Project Structure: Insights from the Actual Implementation

### The Folder Hierarchy Philosophy

Our project structure follows a **"documentation-first, code-last"** philosophy where planning artifacts get first-class treatment alongside (and before) source code.

### Key Structural Insights

#### 1. **`project-context/` as the "Brain" of the Project**

**Insight**: All planning, decisions, and knowledge live in `project-context/`. This creates a **clear separation between "what we're building" (documentation) and "how it's built" (code)**.

**Benefits**:
- New team members (AI or human) start here, not in `src/`
- Easy to find all project decisions in one place
- Documentation doesn't pollute source code directories
- Can delete and regenerate code without losing project knowledge

**Pattern to Reuse**:
```bash
# Always create project-context/ first
mkdir -p project-context/{requirements-and-analysis,specifications,adr,planning,implementation,build-logs,learnings,agents,archive}
```

#### 2. **Archive Strategy: "Preserve, Don't Delete"**

**Observation**: We have `archive/` folders at multiple levels:
- `project-context/archive/` - General planning documents
- `project-context/adr/archive/` - Superseded ADRs
- `project-context/planning/archive/` - Delivery plans after finalization
- `project-context/specifications/archive/` - Review notes and update plans

**Insight**: **Archiving preserves decision history without cluttering active workspace**.

**Pattern**:
```bash
# After incorporating feedback/refinement:
mv project-context/specifications/prd-v0.1-review-notes.md \
   project-context/specifications/archive/

# Always add README.md to archive explaining what's there and why
cat > project-context/adr/archive/README.md << 'EOF'
# Archived ADRs

This folder contains superseded ADRs. They are kept for historical reference.

- ADR-0001: Superseded by ADR-0001-v2 (SQLite + Postgres instead of Postgres-only)
EOF
```

**Why This Matters**: 6 months from now, someone asks "why did we choose Postgres?" You can show both ADR-0001 (original reasoning) and ADR-0001-v2 (the revision and why).

#### 3. **Implementation Folder: More Than Just Code**

**Structure**:
```
implementation/
├── tasks/
│   ├── tasks.json              # Master orchestration (50 tasks)
│   ├── task_001.json           # Self-contained context
│   ├── task_014.json
│   └── README.md               # Task system guide
├── PROGRESS.md                 # Human dashboard
├── TRACKING-WORKFLOW.md        # Workflow documentation
└── README.md                   # Implementation guide
```

**Insight**: `implementation/` is the **bridge between planning and coding**. It's where abstract requirements become concrete, executable work packages.

**Key Files**:
- `tasks.json`: The "operating system" for task execution (dependencies, groups, agents)
- `PROGRESS.md`: The "dashboard" showing real-time status
- `TRACKING-WORKFLOW.md`: The "manual" for using the tracking system

**Pattern to Reuse**: Always create the implementation folder structure before writing any code. Populate tasks.json with all tasks, then start executing.

#### 4. **Agent Organization: Library vs. Project**

**Two-Tier System**:
```
project-context/agents/
└── all-agents-library/          # 90+ agents, organized by category
    ├── core/                    # coder, tester, reviewer, planner
    ├── analysis/                # code-analyzer, quality checks
    ├── development/backend/     # backend-architect, dev-backend-api
    ├── specialized/mobile/      # React Native experts
    ├── testing/                 # tdd-london-swarm, production-validator
    ├── devops/                  # deployment, CI/CD
    ├── documentation/           # docs-maintainer, API docs
    ├── consensus/               # Distributed systems agents
    ├── swarm/                   # Multi-agent coordination
    └── templates/               # Reusable agent templates

.claude/agents/                  # 20 project-specific agents (copied)
└── [20 agents needed for this project]
```

**Insight**: **Agent library is a reusable "recruitment pool"**. Each project copies only what it needs to `.claude/agents/`.

**Why Two Locations?**:
- `project-context/agents/all-agents-library/`: **Global library** (90+ agents, grows over time, reused across projects)
- `.claude/agents/`: **Project-specific** (only agents needed for this project, loaded by Claude Code)

**Pattern to Reuse**:
```bash
# 1. Maintain global library in project-context/agents/all-agents-library/
# 2. Create agent-resourcing-plan.md mapping agents to milestones
# 3. Copy required agents to .claude/agents/
cp project-context/agents/all-agents-library/core/coder.md .claude/agents/
cp project-context/agents/all-agents-library/testing/tdd-london-swarm.md .claude/agents/
# ... (20 total for this project)
```

**Bonus Insight**: Agent library has **16 categories**:
- Core (5): Foundational agents (coder, tester, reviewer, planner, researcher)
- Analysis (2): Code quality, review automation
- Development (1): Backend API specialists
- Specialized (1): Mobile (React Native)
- Testing (2): Unit (TDD), validation (production)
- DevOps (1): Deployment & CI/CD
- Documentation (1): API docs (OpenAPI)
- Consensus (7): Distributed systems (Raft, Byzantine, Quorum, CRDT, Gossip)
- Swarm (3): Multi-agent coordination (hierarchical, mesh, adaptive)
- Hive-Mind (3): Collective intelligence, swarm memory
- Optimization (5): Performance, load balancing, resource allocation
- Templates (8): Reusable patterns (SPARC, automation, migration)
- Database (6): Postgres & Supabase specialists
- Project Management (4): Cross-project coordination, progress tracking
- Architecture (1): System design
- Data/ML (1): Machine learning models

#### 5. **Specifications: Versioned Evolution**

**Structure**:
```
specifications/
├── prd-technical_spec.md          # v0.3 (current)
└── archive/
    ├── prd-v0.3-update-plan.md    # External review feedback plan
    ├── prd-tech-sepec-v1-review.md # v0.1 review notes
    └── prd-review-feedback-and-action.md # v0.2 → v0.3 action plan
```

**Insight**: **PRD evolved through 3 versions, each refinement archived for history**.

**Evolution Path**:
1. v0.1: Initial draft from requirements PDF
2. v0.1 review: Self-review with clarification questions
3. v0.2: Answered all questions, added clarity
4. External review: Critical feedback from outside perspective
5. v0.3 update plan: Action items from external review
6. v0.3: Final specification incorporating all feedback

**Pattern**: Version your specs. Archive review notes and update plans. The **spec file itself contains the latest version number in its content**.

#### 6. **ADR Folder: Living Documentation with Index**

**Structure**:
```
adr/
├── README.md                    # 🎯 ADR INDEX (critical!)
├── ADR-0001-v2-storage-choice.md
├── ADR-0002-architecture-style.md
├── ADR-0003-processor-strategy-pattern.md
├── ADR-0004-swagger-api-contract.md
├── ADR-0005-versioning-via-uri.md
├── ADR-0006-api-key-authentication.md
├── ADR-0007-response-contract-design.md
├── ADR-0008-parsing-validation-rules.md
├── ADR-0009-bankers-rounding.md
├── ADR-0010-test-strategy-coverage.md
└── archive/
    ├── README.md                # Explains what's archived and why
    ├── ADR-0001-storage-choice.md  # Superseded by v2
    └── ADR-UPDATE-PLAN.md       # Planning doc for ADR updates
```

**Insight**: **README.md as ADR index is the navigation hub**. Without it, you have 10 ADR files with no quick overview.

**ADR Index Format**:
```markdown
# Architecture Decision Records

Complete index of all ADRs for Flowingly Parsing Service.

## Active ADRs

| ID | Title | Status | Date |
|----|-------|--------|------|
| ADR-0001-v2 | Storage Choice (SQLite + Postgres) | Accepted | 2025-10-06 |
| ADR-0002 | Clean/Hexagonal Architecture | Accepted | 2025-10-05 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Superseded ADRs

See `archive/` folder for historical decisions.
```

**Pattern**: Always maintain ADR index. Update it with every new ADR. Link to superseded versions.

#### 7. **Build Logs: Chronological, Append-Only**

**Structure**:
```
build-logs/
├── README.md               # Explains BUILDLOG purpose and format
└── BUILDLOG.md            # Chronological history (oldest→newest)
```

**Insight**: **Chronological ordering (oldest→newest) makes appending trivial**. New entries just `echo >> BUILDLOG.md`.

**BUILDLOG Header** (added during this project):
```markdown
# Build Log - Flowingly Parsing Service

**Note**: Entries are in chronological order (oldest first, newest at bottom).
New entries should be appended to the end of this file.

---
```

**Pattern**:
- Oldest→newest ordering (not reverse chronological)
- Standardized entry format (date, changes, rationale, testing, deployment, next steps)
- Automated milestone entries via `update-progress.sh`

#### 8. **Learnings Folder: Institutional Knowledge**

**Structure**:
```
learnings/
├── serena-mcp-guide.md              # MCP tool usage guide
└── project-setup-methodology.md     # This document
```

**Insight**: **`learnings/` captures "how we work" knowledge** that's not in specs or ADRs.

**Types of Learning Documents**:
- **Tool guides**: How to use specific tools (serena-mcp-guide.md)
- **Methodology guides**: Process and workflow (project-setup-methodology.md)
- **Pattern libraries**: Reusable code/doc patterns
- **Troubleshooting guides**: Common issues and solutions
- **Lessons learned**: Post-mortems, retrospectives

**Pattern**: After completing a project phase, document learnings while they're fresh. Future projects will thank you.

#### 9. **Scripts: Automation is First-Class**

**Structure**:
```
scripts/
└── update-progress.sh         # Progress tracking automation
```

**Insight**: **Automation scripts get their own top-level folder**, not buried in `project-context/` or `tools/`.

**Why Top-Level?**:
- Easy to find: `./scripts/update-progress.sh`
- Easy to execute: No deep paths
- Clear purpose: "If it's in scripts/, it automates something"

**Pattern**: Create `scripts/` folder early. Add automation as needed (progress tracking, verification, deployment, etc.).

#### 10. **`.claude/` Configuration: Project-Specific AI Setup**

**Structure**:
```
.claude/
├── agents/                    # 20 project agents (copied from library)
│   ├── backend-architect.md
│   ├── tdd-london-swarm.md
│   └── ... (18 more)
└── settings.local.json        # Claude Code settings
```

**Insight**: **`.claude/` is where project meets AI**. It's the configuration layer that tells Claude Code how to work on this project.

**What Goes Here**:
- **Agents**: Project-specific agents copied from library
- **Settings**: Claude Code configuration (local, not committed if sensitive)
- **Commands**: Custom slash commands (if any)
- **Prompts**: Reusable prompt templates

**Pattern**:
```bash
# Setup .claude/ during Phase 4 (Task Decomposition)
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# Copy agents based on agent-resourcing-plan.md
# [Copy 20 agents as documented earlier]

# Gitignore strategy:
# - Commit .claude/agents/ (project-specific)
# - Gitignore .claude/settings.local.json (machine-specific)
```

### Structural Anti-Patterns We Avoided

❌ **Don't**: Put documentation in `docs/` separate from planning context
✅ **Do**: Use `project-context/` as single hub for all planning/docs

❌ **Don't**: Delete old specs/reviews ("we don't need this anymore")
✅ **Do**: Archive them with README explaining why

❌ **Don't**: Mix code and planning in same folder structure
✅ **Do**: Separate concerns (project-context/ for planning, src/ for code)

❌ **Don't**: Store ADRs as flat list with no index
✅ **Do**: Maintain ADR index (README.md) as navigation hub

❌ **Don't**: Put scripts in random locations (tools/, bin/, misc/)
✅ **Do**: Top-level `scripts/` folder for all automation

❌ **Don't**: Reverse-chronological BUILDLOG (newest first)
✅ **Do**: Chronological (oldest→newest) for append-friendly updates

❌ **Don't**: Copy entire agent library to .claude/agents/
✅ **Do**: Copy only project-required agents (20 of 90)

### The Folder Structure as a System

**Key Realization**: The folder structure isn't just organization—it's a **system for managing project knowledge**.

```
Requirements (immutable)
    ↓
Specifications (versioned, evolved)
    ↓
ADRs (decisions with context)
    ↓
Planning (delivery, gap analysis, optimization)
    ↓
Implementation (task system, progress tracking)
    ↓
Build Logs (historical record)
    ↓
Learnings (institutionalized knowledge)
    ↓
[Future] Code (guided by all of the above)
```

Each folder builds on the previous:
1. **requirements-and-analysis**: Raw input
2. **specifications**: Structured interpretation
3. **adr**: Key decisions extracted
4. **planning**: Delivery strategy
5. **implementation**: Executable tasks
6. **build-logs**: Historical record
7. **learnings**: Future guidance

**This creates a "knowledge waterfall"** where each layer refines and builds on the previous.

### Reusable Folder Structure Template

#!/bin/bash
# create-project-structure.sh

PROJECT_NAME="$1"
mkdir -p "$PROJECT_NAME"

## Final Thoughts

This methodology transformed a 4-page PDF into a fully-planned, implementation-ready project in 6 hours with:
- **10 ADRs** documenting every architectural decision
- **PRD v0.3** refined through 3 cycles and external review
- **50 tasks** with self-contained context for autonomous execution
- **3-file progress tracking system** with automation
- **Zero lines of production code** and **zero technical debt**

The investment in planning paid off:
- Clear north star (what's submittable vs. nice-to-have)
- No ambiguity (every decision documented)
- No requirements hunting (context embedded in tasks)
- Effortless progress tracking (automation prevents drift)

**Apply this methodology to your next project. Your implementation-phase self will thank your planning-phase self.**
