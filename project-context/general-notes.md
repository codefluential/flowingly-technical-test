# General Notes

Capturing my thoughts as I work through this.

##  In Summary report or email
 - show broad thinking, planning and specification for implementation to cover end to end SDLC/DevOps and cross cutting concerns but keep it practical and simple for implementation
 - a lot of these would normally require deeper thought and sepcifciation/planning but for the purpose of the constraint - starting Sunday evening for delivery tomorrow, balance scope and complexity according but showcase broad thinking.


 ## Side thoughts
 - AI integration would be cool - AI based parsing using gemini 2.5 pro - multmodal - text and image (generate an NZ GST Invoice example)


# Claude.md rules

- Use TDD/BDD developmentt methodololy - keep it reasonable, do not over-engineer. Include core features and some edge cases. Alway priortise happy path first.
- Use conventional commit syntax for git commits
- Use best practice, patterns and principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI) for each relevant stack, solution architecture and code implementation. Alway choose simple, maintainable and extensible over complex solutions.
- Alway check impementation and specification to verify what needs to be implement and has been implented when planing tasks or implementing code
- Documentation just enough so it is not onerous to maintain between  markdown guides and code comments. The most maitainable options foe each context.
- stick to the specification provided - this is a minimal app to demostrate broad coding capabilities to producde simple and maintainable codebase. Key documents are
    - [list of key document location and tasks]
- Maintain these documents
    - ADRs at [folder location]
    - Build Logs at  [folder location]
