## 2025-10-06 03:17 - Task Decomposition and Implementation System

**Changes**:
- Created master task orchestration (tasks.json) with 50 Phase 1 tasks
- Defined 5 parallel execution groups (15+ tasks can run concurrently)
- Created self-contained task files with complete context:
  - task_001: M0 solution structure with Clean Architecture context
  - task_014: M1 tag validation tests (TDD RED) with ADR-0008 stack-based validation
  - task_019: M1 Banker's Rounding tests (TDD RED) with ADR-0009 MidpointRounding.ToEven
  - task_031: M2 DTOs with ADR-0007 XOR response contract
- Created task system documentation (README, status tracking)
- Created comprehensive Phase 1 implementation guide
- Copied 20 required agents from library to `.claude/agents/`

**Rationale**:
Task decomposition enables autonomous agent execution with full context embedded in each task. No hunting for requirements—each task includes PRD sections, test brief pages, ADR excerpts, business rules, code examples, and acceptance criteria. Parallel execution groups enable concurrent work on independent components. Agent copy ensures all required agents available for task execution per resourcing plan.

**Issues/Blockers**:
None. Task system complete and ready for implementation.

**Testing**:
Task graph enforces TDD discipline (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR) with strict dependencies. 8 TDD task pairs ensure tests written before implementation.

**Deployment**:
N/A - No code implementation yet. Task system ready to guide implementation.

**Next Steps**:
1. Execute task_001: Create .NET solution structure following Clean Architecture
2. Follow task sequence through M0→M1→M2→M3
3. Use parallel execution groups where safe (15+ tasks can run concurrently)
4. Verify milestone DoD gates before proceeding (tasks 010, 030, 040, 050)
5. Achieve submittable product after task_050 (45+ tests green, clone→run→verify <5 min)
