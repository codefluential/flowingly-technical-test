Implementation log documenting development progress, changes, and decisions.

## 2025-10-05 21:30 - Project Setup and Specification Phase

**Changes**:
- Created project structure with `project-context/` for documentation
- Created `requirements-and-analysis/` folder with original test requirements PDF
- Created `specifications/` folder with PRD + Technical Specification (v0.1)
- Added specification review notes with clarification questions
- Created `general-notes.md` with development methodology and AI agent guidelines
- Established `adr/` folder for Architecture Decision Records
- Established `build-logs/` folder for implementation tracking
- Added `.gitignore` for requirements artifacts

**Rationale**:
Establish clear documentation structure before implementation begins. The PRD + Technical Specification provides comprehensive blueprint covering architecture, API design, data model, security, testing strategy, and deployment approach. Review notes capture necessary clarifications to refine specification before coding starts.

**Issues/Blockers**:
None. Planning phase proceeding smoothly.

**Testing**:
N/A - Documentation phase.

**Deployment**:
N/A - No code implementation yet.

**Next Steps**:
1. Refine PRD v0.1 based on review notes
2. Create initial ADRs (storage, architecture, patterns)
3. Set up backend .NET solution structure
4. Set up frontend React project structure
5. Initialize test frameworks (xUnit, Playwright)
