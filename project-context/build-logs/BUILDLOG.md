# Build Log - Flowingly Parsing Service

Implementation log documenting development progress, changes, and decisions.

## 2025-10-05 22:15 - Architecture Decision Records Created

**Changes**:
- Created ADR-0001: PostgreSQL as primary data store
- Created ADR-0002: Clean/Hexagonal Architecture with CQRS-lite
- Created ADR-0003: Strategy Pattern for content processors
- Created ADR-0004: Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
- Created ADR-0005: URI-based API versioning

**Rationale**:
Document key architectural decisions before implementation begins. Each ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of core architectural choices that will guide development. These decisions align with the technical specification and provide clear guidance for implementation.

**Issues/Blockers**:
None.

**Testing**:
N/A - Documentation phase.

**Deployment**:
N/A - No code implementation yet.

**Next Steps**:
Continue refining PRD based on review feedback.

## 2025-10-06 09:30 - CLAUDE.md Enhancement and Project Infrastructure

**Changes**:
- Enhanced `CLAUDE.md` with framework-specific guidelines for React and .NET
- Added root `.gitignore` with placeholder structure
- Fixed `.gitignore` syntax issues and untracked working files
- Refined development guidelines with evidence-based approach

**Rationale**:
Improve AI agent guidance and project infrastructure. Framework-specific rules ensure consistent development patterns. Proper `.gitignore` prevents tracking of artifacts and working files.

**Issues/Blockers**:
Initial `.gitignore` had syntax errors, corrected in follow-up commit.

**Testing**:
N/A - Documentation phase.

**Deployment**:
N/A - No code implementation yet.

## 2025-10-06 10:45 - PRD v0.1 Review and Refinement to v0.2

**Changes**:
- Created comprehensive review notes for PRD v0.1 with clarification questions
- Updated PRD to v0.2 with comprehensive clarifications and refinements
- Archived v0.1 review notes after incorporation into v0.2
- Updated ADRs 0001, 0002, and 0004 for alignment with PRD v0.2
- Created ADR-0006 for API key authentication in production

**Rationale**:
First major specification refinement cycle. PRD v0.2 addresses ambiguities in tax calculations, validation rules, error handling, and deployment strategy. Added API key authentication decision to cover production security requirements.

**Issues/Blockers**:
None. Review process revealed areas needing clarification, all addressed in v0.2.

**Testing**:
N/A - Specification phase.

**Deployment**:
N/A - No code implementation yet.

## 2025-10-06 14:20 - External Review and PRD v0.3 Planning

**Changes**:
- Added external critical review of PRD v0.2 with implementation guidance
- Created PRD v0.3 update plan based on external review feedback
- Added comprehensive delivery plan with milestone breakdown

**Rationale**:
External review provided critical feedback on specification quality and implementation approach. Delivery plan breaks down work into clear milestones with realistic timeframes and dependencies. This planning ensures structured implementation phase.

**Issues/Blockers**:
None. External review highlighted areas for improvement, addressed in planning phase.

**Testing**:
N/A - Planning phase.

**Deployment**:
N/A - No code implementation yet.

**Next Steps**:
1. Update PRD to v0.3 incorporating external review feedback
2. Archive planning documents
3. Begin implementation of Milestone 1 (Backend foundation)

---

## 2025-10-06 16:00 - PRD v0.3 Finalization and Archive

**Changes**:
- Updated PRD to v0.3 based on external review feedback
- Archived PRD v0.3 review and planning documents
- Finalized specification for implementation phase

**Rationale**:
Complete specification refinement cycle. PRD v0.3 represents the final specification incorporating all review feedback and clarifications. Archiving planning documents maintains clean documentation structure while preserving decision history.

**Issues/Blockers**:
None. Specification phase complete.

**Testing**:
N/A - Specification complete, ready for implementation.

**Deployment**:
N/A - No code implementation yet.

**Next Steps**:
1. Set up backend .NET solution structure
2. Set up frontend React project structure
3. Initialize test frameworks (xUnit, Playwright)
4. Begin Milestone 1 implementation: Backend foundation with domain models and parsers

## 2025-10-05 21:30 - Project Setup and Specification Phase

**Changes**:
- Created project structure with `project-context/` for documentation
- Created `requirements-and-analysis/` folder with original test requirements PDF
- Created `specifications/` folder with PRD + Technical Specification (v0.1)
- Added specification review notes with clarification questions
- Created `general-notes.md` with development methodology and AI agent guidelines
- Established `adr/` folder for Architecture Decision Records
- Established `build-logs/` folder for implementation tracking
- Added `.gitignore` for requirements artifacts

**Rationale**:
Establish clear documentation structure before implementation begins. The PRD + Technical Specification provides comprehensive blueprint covering architecture, API design, data model, security, testing strategy, and deployment approach. Review notes capture necessary clarifications to refine specification before coding starts.

**Issues/Blockers**:
None. Planning phase proceeding smoothly.

**Testing**:
N/A - Documentation phase.

**Deployment**:
N/A - No code implementation yet.

**Next Steps**:
1. Refine PRD v0.1 based on review notes
2. Create initial ADRs (storage, architecture, patterns)
3. Set up backend .NET solution structure
4. Set up frontend React project structure
5. Initialize test frameworks (xUnit, Playwright)
