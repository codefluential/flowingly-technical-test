## How to Use These Agents

### 1. Identify Your Need
First, clearly define what you need to accomplish:
- What phase of the project are you in? (Planning, Implementation, Testing, Deployment)
- What specific deliverable or task needs completion?
- What technical domain does it involve? (Backend, Frontend, Database, DevOps)

### 2. Select Appropriate Agents
Based on your needs, select agents from the relevant categories:
- For initial planning: Use **planner.md** with **project-organizer.md**
- For implementation: Combine **coder.md** with domain specialists (e.g., **backend-architect.md**)
- For testing: Deploy **tester.md** with **testing/unit/tdd-london-swarm.md**
- For documentation: Use **docs-maintainer.md** with **documentation/api-docs/docs-api-openapi.md**

### 3. Consider Agent Teams
Many tasks benefit from multiple agents working together:
- **Full Feature Implementation**: planner ‚Üí backend-architect ‚Üí coder ‚Üí tester ‚Üí reviewer
- **API Development**: backend-architect ‚Üí dev-backend-api ‚Üí docs-api-openapi
- **Release Process**: release-manager ‚Üí production-validator ‚Üí deployment-architect

### 4. Invoke Agents
Reference agents by their filename (without .md extension) when requesting their assistance:
```
"I need the backend-architect agent to design the API structure for the expense parser"
"Please use the tdd-london-swarm agent to implement test cases for the tag validator"
```
