# Notes from Full Stack Engineer Test (Sen) V2.pdf

## Objective
The objective of this proect is to demonstrate implementation of maintainable and testable code and ideally a working solution based on the required in the document supllied /home/adarsh/dev/codefluent/flowingly-technical-test/project-context/Full Stack Engineer Test (Sen) V2.pdf

This document are the instrcution and boundaries based on my decisions on how to implement this application.

Goals there fore are to demonstrate:
- analysis ad planning and setting scope for application
- deliverr based on constraints
- show methodology and justitifications
- implemenet to demonstrated the decision taken to create an app that is easy to maintain uses best practice and principles - SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Clean Code, Secure, Reliable, Resilient< Extensible,, Scalable

## Method
- Create architecture based on traget platform - DevOps 
- Comntainerised
- Split into layers Frontend and API Layer/Backend Logic Layer
- TDD/BDD approach

## Tecnhnical Stack
- React Front End (as specified)
- Rest API - ASP.NET Core Web API (as specified)
- C# for BLL
- Docker
- Swagger for API dcumentation
- SQLLite Datalayer with appropritae patterns and ORM ro Save data recievd and processed
